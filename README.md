# Spinterest_Documentation
This repository documents my role as the product lead for a class project where I oversaw requirements gathering, user documentation, feature planning, and cross-functional coordination. It consolidates artifacts such as the problem statement, user research summaries, user stories, wireframes, acceptance criteria, and project retrospective.
