# Spinterest_Documentation
A product management case study for Spinterest, a MERN-stack music discovery platform designed to help Spotify users share playlists, explore niche music tastes, and connect with others through curated collections. This repo documents my contributions as the product lead, including the vision, requirements, user flows, user stories, and decision-making that guided the project from concept through implementation.
