# Spinterest — Product Management Case Study
This repository presents the product management documentation for Spinterest, a social music discovery platform created as part of an academic team project. While the engineering work remains in the original source-code repository, this repo focuses on the product direction, research, planning, and cross-functional leadership that shaped the project. 


## Project Overview
Spinterest was designed to solve a clear problem:
Music lovers often struggle to share their curated playlists or discover niche playlists outside their immediate Spotify network. Spinterest creates a space where users can explore collections crafted by others, follow friends, and find music based on shared vibes, genres, and listening habits. 
## What This Repository Contains
This repo consolidates the PM artifacts I produced or led during development:

Product vision, problem statement, and goal definition

User personas (e.g., Simon the indie explorer, Aimee the café owner) 

Complete user story set (308 implemented stories + 309 planned for social features) 

Requirements & acceptance criteria

Updated feature specifications based on evolving constraints (e.g., Spotify rate-limit issues) 

Activity diagrams, state flows, and UI prototypes

Data model revisions & rationale

Non-functional & technical requirements

Retrospectives, open questions, and iteration decisions
## My PM Responsibilities Included
Leading product vision, scoping, and feasibility evaluation

Documenting user stories and acceptance criteria

Prioritizing features and adjusting scope based on API limitations (Spotify rate limits)

Coordinating between dev roles, UI/UX, and backend contributors

Managing iterative updates, schema changes, and release planning

Ensuring alignment between personas, requirements, and delivered functionality

Helping define the data model, dashboard experience, and social features roadmap
## Tech Stack & Platform Context
The engineering team implemented Spinterest using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node), paired with the Spotify API for user listening data, playlists, and authentication.
My role involved guiding how these technical choices mapped to product feasibility and long-term goals.
